Dusk Map Editor v 2.0.0

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Intro:

The Dusk Map Editor is made to provide ease of editing to map files for those starting a new dusk world, or for making large changes to existing worlds, and is not really meant for day-to-day editing.  For more information about Dusk, stop by the official Dusk web site at:

This is a 'beta' release of a dusk map editor I wrote in VB 6.0.  Because VB is a native language, it will only work in Windows.  (It has currently been tested on both Windows 98 and Windows 2000.)  Sorry all you Mac and Linux guys out there!

So far, it looks to be working as it should, but there still may be some bugs in the program.  Let me know if you have any problems using it, or if you have any suggestions.  While this program is being tested, I highly recommend you make a backup of any map file you edit prior to using it.

Section 1:  Installation and Use

-  To install the program, unzip the setup files to a folder, and run setup.exe from that folder.

-  After installation, you may open 'Dusk Map Editor' from the start menu.

-  To open a map, or create a new map, click on the 'file' menu item, and then select the option you wish to use.

-  Once the map is loaded, or a new map is created, you can load the map image file you are using or wish to use.  To do this, select 'Open Image Array' from the Map menu, or click on the image array button on the left side of the window (3rd button).  Note that the map will not be visible until you do this.

-  To make changes to the map, select the tile you wish to use from the array on the right side, then click or 'draw' that map tile on the map itself.  The active map tile will be shown above the array you selected from.
   
-  As you draw on the map, the new map is written into memory, and you can scroll to see and edit different parts of the map. 

-  To save the map, select 'Save Map' from the Map menu, and give the map a name.

-  You can now use the saved map in any dusk world.  Note that dusk uses "shortmap" as the file name, without the .map extension.  The .map extension allows for opening of maps by double clicking on the map from explorer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2:  Tips

-  A grid can be toggled on the map by clicking the grid button (5th Button), or clicking 'Toggle grid' from the 'Map' menu.

-  You can 'teleport' to a location on a map by clicking 'Goto' from the Map menu.

-  ***NEW***  If you are changing the image array file you are using with a particular map, you can use the 'Convert Values" from the 'Map' menu to convert all tiles of a certain value to a new tile.

-  ***NEW***  A full map viewer is now included which can be accessed by clicking on 'View Entire Map' from the 'Map' menu.  This will open a 'snapshot' of your entire world based on average colors of the tiles used.  This file can be saved in bitmap (*.bmp) format.

-  ***NEW***  The Map area can be 'zoomed' by either clicking 'Zoom' from the 'Map' menu, or by clicking the zoom button on the left of the screen.  Zoom values can be from 10x to 40x.  The larger the zoom value, the more map area you can see on the given screen.

-  ***NEW***  The Dusk Map Editor is now resizable.  No more problems with the width and height being too large or too small!  Just size the window (or maximize it) to meet your needs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3:  Limitations

-  The world viewer is very cpu intensive.  It may take some time to load the map into a bitmap, especially for large image arrays.

-  If you are editing an existing dusk world map, remember that once you save the map as the shortmap, you will need to shutdown, and restart the dusk server in order for dusk to load the new map.  Otherwise, the old map will still be in memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 4:  Up and coming

-  Near future - Undo feature to undo last action only.

-  Near future - "Paint Bucket" feature to paint large areas with a chosen tile.

-  Near future - Ability to import bitmap into editor (reverse of world view).

-  Distant future - Adding support for mob editing, item, character scripts, etc.  That is if I can figure all that stuff out!  ;)

-  Distant future - Adding online editing support?  This one is 'iffy' at best.  I wouldn't want to defeat the security of the game.
